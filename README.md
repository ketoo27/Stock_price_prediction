Project Overview
The Stock Prediction Web App is an interactive web-based platform that enables users to analyze stock trends, predict future stock prices, and manage their favorite stocks. Built using Streamlit, TensorFlow, and Yahoo Finance API, the app provides an intuitive interface for stock market enthusiasts to make informed decisions based on historical data and machine learning predictions.

Key Features
ðŸ”¹ User Authentication & Profile Management

A personalized profile page displays the userâ€™s favorite stocks.
Users can add or remove stocks from their favorites.
ðŸ“ˆ Stock Data Visualization
Fetches real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance.
Displays historical price trends using Matplotlib and Plotly.
Shows moving averages (50-day & 200-day) for trend analysis.
ðŸ”® Stock Price Prediction using LSTM Model
Uses a trained LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict future stock prices.
Compares predicted vs. actual stock prices in graphical format.
